## Overview

This repository contains the embedded software developed for the **TAILS** (Tactical Aerial Insight and Localization Suite) system. The embedded code runs on a [Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 (V3)](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v3/) board and is responsible for communication, telemetry, and interfacing with onboard sensors (e.g. GPS, IMU). The firmware enables reliable transmission of drone location and sensor data via LoRa to a centralized receiver station.

The project is written in C++ and built using the [Arduino framework](https://www.arduino.cc/), targeting a modified ESP32 microcontroller, with additional support for SX1262-based LoRa modules and UBlox GPS receivers.

## Features
- üß† **AI Object Detection & POI Recognition**: Point of Interest (POI) object detection enables automated identification of key landmarks or objects; selectable via configuration on mobile app.
- üõ∞Ô∏è **LoRa Telemetry Transmission**: Real-time transmission of position and altitude data.
- üìç **GPS Integration**: Reads NMEA sentences and parses location data from UBlox modules.
- üì° **BLE Peripheral Support**: Allows configuration and basic diagnostics over BLE.
